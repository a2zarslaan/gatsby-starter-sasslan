## Quick Start

Run the following in your favorite terminal:

```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/a2zarslaan/gatsby-starter-sasslan
```

## Starting from Scratch

- Set up Npm: (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)[https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm]
- Install the Gatsby CLI globally:

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

- Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:

gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/a2zarslaan/gatsby-starter-sasslan
```

For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:

gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/a2zarslaan/gatsby-starter-sasslan
```

```
npm run deploy
```
