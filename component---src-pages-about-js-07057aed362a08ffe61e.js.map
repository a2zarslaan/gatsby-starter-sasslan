This motivates me to\n          invest all my free time in learning something new, honing my skills\n          and improving personal efficiency. In design and development of\n          products, I prioritise utility and minimalism. Having worked with\n          diverse teams on several projects in the past, I consider myself a\n          great team player who believes that individual action supported by a\n          collaborative effort is the crux of great achievements. In my past\n          projects I have strictly followed the most up to date industry\n          practices and workflows.\n        </p>\n      </Container>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default AboutPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
