This motivates me to invest all my free time in learning something new, honing my skills and improving personal efficiency. In design and development of products, I prioritise utility and minimalism. Having worked with diverse teams on several projects in the past, I consider myself a great team player who believes that individual action supported by a collaborative effort is the crux of great achievements. In my past projects I have strictly followed the most up to date industry practices and workflows.")))}}}]);
